Hello, my name is Wagner Melo and I'm a software engineering with more than 5 year experience working with IT Solutions and Softwares. I live in Brazil and I'm obsessed with coding. I have the habit to study every day because as you may know, our profession is always envolving and search for new knowledges is the main focus for me. I code since I was 17. I have some personal projects hosting on Github. Feel free to ask anything and I'm here to help you.
